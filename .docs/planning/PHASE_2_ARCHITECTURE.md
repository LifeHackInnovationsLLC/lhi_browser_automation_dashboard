# Phase 2: Architecture Design

**Status**: ⏸️ NOT STARTED  
**Target Start**: 2025-01-11  
**Target Completion**: 2025-01-13  

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Phase 1 documentation retrieval complete
- [ ] All dependencies documented
- [ ] Current infrastructure mapped
- [ ] Component inventory complete

## Objectives
1. Design modular system architecture
2. Create component hierarchy
3. Plan state management approach
4. Define module boundaries
5. Design data flow patterns

## Agent Assignments

### Agent 1: System Architect
**Type**: Serial Execution  
**Status**: ⏸️ Not Started  

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create layered architecture diagram
- [ ] Define module boundaries
- [ ] Design data flow patterns
- [ ] Plan state management approach
- [ ] Document API contracts

**Architecture Decisions**:
*To be populated*

### Agent 2: Component Designer
**Type**: Parallel Execution  
**Status**: ⏸️ Not Started  

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create component hierarchy
- [ ] Design BrowserCard variants
- [ ] Plan ProfileSelector component
- [ ] Design ScriptLibrary interface
- [ ] Plan RecordingControls layout

**Component Designs**:
*To be populated*

### Agent 3: Integration Architect
**Type**: Serial Execution  
**Status**: ⏸️ Not Started  

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Design MCP adapter pattern
- [ ] Plan profile management service
- [ ] Design script conversion engine
- [ ] Plan monitoring architecture
- [ ] Document communication patterns

**Integration Strategy**:
*To be populated*

## Key Design Decisions

### Architecture Pattern
- [ ] Layered Architecture
- [ ] Module boundaries
- [ ] Service layer design
- [ ] Data layer design

### State Management
- [ ] Redux vs Context API vs Zustand
- [ ] State shape definition
- [ ] Action patterns
- [ ] Side effects handling

### Component Architecture
- [ ] Component hierarchy
- [ ] Props vs composition
- [ ] Styling patterns
- [ ] Reusability strategy

### Integration Patterns
- [ ] MCP adapter design
- [ ] Service interfaces
- [ ] Event handling
- [ ] Error boundaries

## Deliverables Checklist
- [ ] target_architecture.md
- [ ] component_hierarchy.md
- [ ] data_flow_diagrams.md
- [ ] state_management_plan.md
- [ ] module_boundaries.md

## Questions to Answer
1. How do we handle submodule vs npm imports?
2. What new UI components need to be added to lhi_ui_framework?
3. How do we manage state across different MCPs?
4. What's the data flow for script recording?
5. How do we ensure profile consistency across MCPs?

## Dependencies on Phase 1
- Need: Complete library documentation
- Need: Current infrastructure analysis
- Need: Component inventory
- Need: Dependency mapping

## Risks & Considerations
*To be identified during phase*
